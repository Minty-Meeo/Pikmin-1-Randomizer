NOTE: All "UPGRADE" tekis will spawn 2 drops of nectar upon defeat, except for Tamago,
which drops 8.  Tamago no longer births a Smoky Progg, and thus is now a rare, beneficial
enemy spawn rather than an annoyance.  Have fun with this new mechanic!

NOTE: All tekis will spawn 0 to 3 number pellets of sizes 1 or 5 upon defeat, except for
Pellet Posies, which drop 1 to 3.

		Emperor Bulblax

		Candypop Bud
	GEYSER
		Water Geyser (off)
		Water Geyser (on)

NOTE: "BASIC" bosses will never randomly remain unchanged, because there's only so many
"BASIC" bosses in vanilla Pikmin 1.  In playtesting, I found the 1/4 chance that a boss
would go unchanged to be uninteresting.  I never even saw Goolix once, and fought Emperor
Bulblax three times.

NOTE: All three colors of Candypop Bud will spawn regardless of which Pikmin colors are
unlocked.  The necessary precautions have been hacked in to avoid game-crashing and
otherwise glitchy side-effects of this change.  Have fun with this new mechanic!

NOTE: All bosses are supposed to drop 1, 5, or 10 pellets.
