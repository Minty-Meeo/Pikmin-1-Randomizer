# Pikmin-1-Randomizer
A Randomizer for Pikmin 1 (GCN/Wii) powered entirely by Gecko Codes

## How to download / What am I downloading
Go to this repository's [release](https://github.com/Minty-Meeo/Pikmin-1-Randomizer/releases) tab.  Download [release.zip](https://github.com/Minty-Meeo/Pikmin-1-Randomizer/releases/download/v1/release.zip).

This package contains \*.txt files with Gecko Codes formatted to be parsed by the Wii Homebrew app [Cheat Manager](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/CheatManager).  Since it's all plaintext, though, you can easily open these files to copy the Gecko Codes into Dolphin's Cheat Code Editor.

## Playing in Dolphin Emulator
In the \*.txt files from "release.zip", copy from the correct files the relevant lines of text into the Gecko Code editor in Dolphin Emulator's Game Properties window.  You can also do this for the "Always Pluckaphone" code if desired.

If playing the GCN USA v1.01 version of Pikmin 1, also boost the MEM1 size in Dolphin's Config window.  32MB should be enough.

## Playing on Real Hardware
IMPORTANT NOTE: GCN versions of Pikmin 1 will run out of memory on real hardware.  I will eventually make a patching script that downscales many textures to alleviate this.

This guide assumes you have a homebrewed Wii with [Cheat Manager](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/CheatManager) and [Gecko OS](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Gecko_OS) installed. 

### Setting up files
Copy the "txtcodes" folder from the download package onto your Wii's SD card.  Merge the folders if necessary.
