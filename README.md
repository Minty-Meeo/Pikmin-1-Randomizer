## Playing on Real Hardware
IMPORTANT NOTE: GCN versions of Pikmin 1 will run out of memory on real hardware.  I will eventually make a patching script that downscales many textures to alleviate this.

This guide assumes you have a homebrewed Wii with [Cheat Manager](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/CheatManager) and [Gecko OS](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Gecko_OS) installed. 

### Setting up files
Copy the "txtcodes" folder from the download package onto your Wii's SD card.  Merge the folders if necessary.
